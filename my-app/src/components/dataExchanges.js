      "The Maiar Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is the Automated Market Maker (AMM), rearchitecting some of the key elements to build a product that can leverage the entire \r\nperformance of the Elrond architecture, to offer global, near-instant, inexpensive transactions among an expanding suite of assets.\r\n\r\nThe essence of current versions of automated market makers is best expressed through the constant product equation: x * y = k\r\n\r\nBased on it, if a swap pool owns some units of token x and some units of token y, it prices trades so that the quantities of x and y resulting after the trade, when multiplied, are equal to a fixed constant, k.\r\n\r\nBut current AMM performance could be significantly improved by rebuilding them on \r\nvastly more scalable architectures.\r\n\r\nBy reimagining an automated market maker on top of a highly scalable architecture that is high bandwidth, low latency, and inexpensive, the performance of the swap processes can be drastically improved. With significantly better performance, the scope of AMMs can be rapidly expanded, giving birth to new mark",

It makes use of the novel Dual Node technology developed by KardiaChain itself. \r\n\r\nThis technology allows simultaneous access to the ledgers of KardiaChain and other blockchain networks. It lets traders retain full control of their assets while being able to transact with fiat currencies and switch between blockchain networks. The main objective of KAIDEX is to facilitate high-speed transactions, high liquidity, and a simple user experience for traders across the globe. In other words, it aims to provide a centralized user experience on a decentralized platform. \r\n\r\nKAIDEX is also working towards facilitating low transaction fees, faster transactions, low slippage, and limit stop loss, and market orders. New technology like this could finally solve the dilemma traders faced for years and increase the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. "',
